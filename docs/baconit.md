## Description

Baconit is a full featured Reddit app for Windows Phone. For a long time it was the top rated app on the Windows Phone store. Baconit included several unique features, like flip view, which allowed browsing Reddit posts one at a time in a horizontal swiping list.

Baconit no longer exits for Windows, Windows Phone, or Xbox. But it lives on in forked versions of the app that are still available on the Windows Store.

## April Fools

Baconit has one of the best April fools pranks on Windows Phone. On April 1st, the app simulated a phone shutdown and reboot, with a failed boot loader. From the start of the joke, the app used shutdown screens and boot screens that matched the OS. By the end of the joke the text revealed it was a joke.

## Releases

Baconit was originally written and released for Windows Phone 7.5 as a C# [Silverlight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Silverlight) app.

It was then ported to the new Windows Phone 8.0 which shared a common code base and app platform with Windows 8.

Finally, Baconit was re-written into the final code base as a Universal Windows App for Windows 10. This version of the app ran on Windows 10, Windows Phone, Hololens, and Xbox.

## Awards

Baconit was submitted into the "Big App On Campus" competition, a Microsoft app competition for collage students. Baconit placed 2nd, earning Quinn and Marilyn a free trip to Austin Texas, for South by South West.

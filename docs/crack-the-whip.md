## Description


The world‑famous (or at least friend‑group‑famous) Crack the Whip app did exactly what its name suggests: it played a whip‑crack sound when users either tapped a button or swung the phone in a whip‑like motion.

Its standout feature was a two‑stage audio effect. Pulling the phone back behind the head triggered the swish of a whip slicing through the air, snapping the phone forward, followed by the sharp crack, completing the illusion.

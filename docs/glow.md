# Glow - Home Decor Ambient Lighting

**Created In: 2015**

## Description

Glow is an IoT‑based home art and information display system powered by a Raspberry Pi. It comprises five paper lanterns, each lit by a multicolor LED, allowing the globes to glow in different hues. The LEDs are driven by a PWM controller attached to a Raspberry Pi running custom software. Because no suitable C# libraries existed at the time, Quinn authored an LED‑animation driver that delivered full multicolor control and smooth color‑transition animations.

The software visualizes data by changing the lantern colors—for example, showing current weather conditions or notification alerts—and exposes a local HTTP server for control.

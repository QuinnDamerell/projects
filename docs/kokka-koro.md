# Kokka Koro

**Created In: 2019**

## Description

Kokka Koro is an Azure App Service that lets users create bots (via an SDK) to compete in a Machi Koro‑style game. Bots can be written in Python or C# and uploaded to the service, which pits them against one another over multiple rounds and tracks the results on a scoreboard.

Quinn built the project while on leave with his infant twins, coding during nap times in the midst of the COVID lockdowns—when there wasn’t much else to do.

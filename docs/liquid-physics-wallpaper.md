## Description

Liquid Physics Live Wallpaper is a highly customizable live background for Android. After activation, it runs a full liquid simulation with gravity that responds to device orientation, giving the impression of real fluid sloshing inside the phone. Users can adjust liquid color, motion blur, gravity sensitivity - including zero‑gravity mode - and particle count.

# MixTok

**Created In: 2019 - Now Defunct**

## Description

MixTok was a brief project that leveraged Mixer.com’s clipping feature to create a TikTok‑style feed. Streamers saved and shared gameplay highlights as clips, which MixTok then indexed, ranked, and presented in a familiar swipeable interface.

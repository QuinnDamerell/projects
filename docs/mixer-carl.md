# Mixer Carl

**Created In: 2019 - Now Defunct**

## Description

Mixer Carl was a playful bot that let Mixer users interact across channels. It tapped into Mixer.com’s public fire‑hose API, which streamed every chat message and presence update. With user consent, Carl could track individuals and let anyone locate or summon a specific user in any channel.

Beloved by many streamers—but irritating to others—Carl was eventually disabled. Not long afterward, Mixer.com shut down.

# Prism

**Created In: 2016**

## Description

Prism is an acrylic, multicolor‑LED desktop display that generates 3‑D patterns. Inspired by the Glow project, it swaps individual LEDs for a 10 × 10 Adafruit NeoPixel grid.

Acrylic columns of varying heights and cut angles refract the grid’s light to produce vivid color patterns. Custom software—available on GitHub—lets users select patterns, rotate them with cross‑fades, schedule on/off times, and manage everything through an HTTP server and web interface.

The finished unit is fully self‑contained except for power: a cardboard base houses a Raspberry Pi Zero W and the 10 × 10 LED matrix.

Quinn used Microsoft Garage’s laser cutter to fabricate the acrylic components.

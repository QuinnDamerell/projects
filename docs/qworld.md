## Description

Q World was a one‑off, DM‑led mash‑up of D&D and escape‑room puzzles created by Quinn for a friend’s birthday. Set in a creepy carnival, the adventure opened with riddles the group had to solve to advance. 

For the finale, players were split into two Discord channels to block direct communication. Each team received a secret word the other side had to guess, but they could converse only through a custom web messenger built for the game. The catch: every message was scrambled with a cipher, so the teams first had to crack the code before they could coordinate.

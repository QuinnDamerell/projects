## Description

The concept behind TxTBack was to create a social experience where users could anonymously text a single phone number, with their messages being forwarded to another participant. The two users remained connected until one chose to switch, allowing for extended conversations.

This idea was inspired by the early days of Omegle.

After being posted on Reddit, the project gained popularity; however, its use of Google Voice soon faced rate-limit restrictions, leading to its shutdown. At that time, the only alternative to Google Voice was SMS API services, which were quite expensive.
